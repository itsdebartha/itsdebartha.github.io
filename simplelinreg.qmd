##  Introduction
This package is a result of my preparation for the Google Summer of Code, 2023. I build this package from the groundup using Julia. The package currently consists of 1 function which enables anyone to find the simple linear regression for two variables.

##  Installation
This package is not intended for the Julia general package repository so we have to install it using the GitHub address.

- Step 1-   Open Julia. Then run the following command:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/itsdebartha/SimpleLinReg.jl.git")
```
