##  Introduction
This package is a result of my preparation for the Google Summer of Code, 2023. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the GSoC 2023, but I did create this package. I build this package from the groundup using Julia. The package currently consists of 1 function which enables anyone to find the simple linear regression between two variables.

##  Installation
This package is not intended for the Julia general package repository so we have to install it using the GitHub address.

- Step 1- Open Julia REPL in your device. Then run the following command:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/itsdebartha/SimpleLinReg.jl.git")
```
- Step 2- The package will be installed. To check, press `]` which will open the Pkg REPL. Then run `st`. You'll be seeing something like:
```julia
(@v1.9) pkg> st
Status `C:\Users\user\.julia\environments\v1.9\Project.toml`
  [4c88cf16] Aqua v0.8.4
  [77b51b56] AverageShiftedHistograms v0.8.9
  [6e4b80f9] BenchmarkTools v1.4.0
  [336ed68f] CSV v0.10.12
  [13f3f980] CairoMakie v0.11.5
  .

```
If you can see `SimpleLinReg` listed (which you should), then the installation is fine.

##  Usage
The main function of interest is `linreg`. It has the basic syntax as:
```julia
linreg(x::Vector,y::Vector;intercept::Bool = true)
```
where `x` is the regressor and `y` is the regressand. The `intercept` field accepts a boolean value which determines whether the intercept term in the simple linear regression be present or not. In short, with `intercept=true` (by default), we estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as in the equation:
$$ y=\alpha + \beta x + \epsilon $$

In case of `intercept=false`, we estimate only `\beta` as in:
$$ y=\beta x + \epsilon $$

Please note that in both the instances, we assume $\epsilon$ to follow $N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$ identically and independently.

##  Output
The output will have the format as:
```julia
SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION IN TWO VARIABLES:
==========================================
Slope:       5.04638
Intercept:   1.98306
```

##  Help Files
Just like any other Julia package, if you press `?` in the REPL, then the Help REPL will open up. Typing `linreg` will give a description of the function along with the method and its syntax.

##  Scope of Improvement
There are many subtle improvements that are needed to mark this package as "complete". Among those are the ability to handle missing values. A more preliminary test of normality is also encouraged. Further, I have planned to implement the significance tests for the estimated parameters.
