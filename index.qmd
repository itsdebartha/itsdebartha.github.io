Hi! I am Debartha Paul (De-bar-tho Paal, দেবার্থ পাল). I am a PhD scholar in the 
[Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/)
at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/).
Currently I am working with Dr. Kyle Schindl.

Before joining ISU, I received my Master of Science in Statistics
in 2024 and my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Statistics in 2022
from [Presidency University, Kolkata](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/).
I am currently working in the domain of Causal Inference.

Apart from academics, I am an ardent follower of football (people
call it [soccer](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-do-some-people-call-football-soccer)
nowadays) and chess. My favourite football club is
[FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/). I also like to
try out new recipes in my free time.
