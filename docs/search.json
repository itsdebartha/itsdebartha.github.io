Currently I am working with Dr. Kyle Schindl.\nBefore joining ISU, I received my Master of Science in Statistics in 2024 and my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Statistics in 2022 from Presidency University, Kolkata. I am currently working in the domain of Causal Inference.\n\n\nThis is my website, and I will keep updating it with a variety of my projects, ideas and (maybe?) articles. I am eager to know what you think and would be very glad if you could point out my mistakes and all. Just drop me an email at pauldeep102@gmail.com or debartha@iastate.edu."

The intercept field accepts a boolean value which determines whether the intercept term in the simple linear regression be present or not. In short, with intercept=true (by default), we estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as in the equation: \\[ y=\\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nIn case of intercept=false, we estimate only \\beta as in: \\[ y=\\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nPlease note that in both the instances, we assume \\(\\epsilon\\) to follow \\(N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\) identically and independently."

What if we roll until there are two rolls in a row that differ by no more than 1(so we stop at a repeated roll, too)?\nWe roll 6-sided die n times. What is the probability that all faces have appeared?\nWe roll a 6-sided die n times. What is the probability that all faces have appeared in order, in some six consecutive rolls (i.e., what is the probability that the sub-sequence 123456 appears among the rolls)?\nPerson A rolls n dice and person B rolls m dice. What is the probability that they have a common face showing (e.g., person A rolled a 2 and person B also rolled a 2, among all their dice)?\nOn average, how many times must a pair of 6-sided dice be rolled until all sides appear at least once?\nSuppose we can roll a 6-sided die up to n times. At any point we can stop, and that roll becomes our “score”. Our goal is to get the highest possible score, on average. How should we decide when to stop?\nSuppose we roll a fair dice 10 times.
