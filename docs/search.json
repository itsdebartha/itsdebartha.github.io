The intercept field accepts a boolean value which determines whether the intercept term in the simple linear regression be present or not. In short, with intercept=true (by default), we estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as in the equation: \\[ y=\\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nIn case of intercept=false, we estimate only \\beta as in: \\[ y=\\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nPlease note that in both the instances, we assume \\(\\epsilon\\) to follow \\(N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\) identically and independently."

What if we roll until there are two rolls in a row that differ by no more than 1(so we stop at a repeated roll, too)?\nWe roll 6-sided die n times. What is the probability that all faces have appeared?\nWe roll a 6-sided die n times. What is the probability that all faces have appeared in order, in some six consecutive rolls (i.e., what is the probability that the sub-sequence 123456 appears among the rolls)?\nPerson A rolls n dice and person B rolls m dice. What is the probability that they have a common face showing (e.g., person A rolled a 2 and person B also rolled a 2, among all their dice)?\nOn average, how many times must a pair of 6-sided dice be rolled until all sides appear at least once?\nSuppose we can roll a 6-sided die up to n times. At any point we can stop, and that roll becomes our “score”. Our goal is to get the highest possible score, on average. How should we decide when to stop?\nSuppose we roll a fair dice 10 times. What is the probability that the sequence of rolls is non-decreasing?"
