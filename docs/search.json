The intercept field accepts a boolean value which determines whether the intercept term in the simple linear regression be present or not. In short, with intercept=true (by default), we estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as in the equation: \\[ y=\\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nIn case of intercept=false, we estimate only \\beta as in: \\[ y=\\beta x + \\epsilon \\]\nPlease note that in both the instances, we assume \\(\\epsilon\\) to follow \\(N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\) identically and independently."

A more preliminary test of normality is also encouraged. Further, I have planned to implement the significance tests for the estimated parameters.\nIf you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me. Even better, you could also create an issue with your suggestion in GitHub."
